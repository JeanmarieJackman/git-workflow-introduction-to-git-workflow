# Git Workflow

## Learning Goals

- Review Git basics
- Preview Git workflow

## Introduction

Developers use version control systems (VCS) to organize our code and the most
commonly used VCS is Git. There are a number of tools and techniques we can use
to effectively integrate Git in our own coding workflow.

## Review Git Basics

At this point, there are several Git actions we should feel comfortable doing,
including:

- Identify how to initialize a Git repository with `git init`
- Check the status of a repository with `git status`
- Keep track of file changes with `git add`
- Create a commit and apply a commit message with `git commit`
- Copy a repository to your local machine with `git clone`
- List remotes with `git remote`
- Duplicate other organizations' repositories into your own via GitHub with `git fork`
- Create a remote repository on GitHub
- Connect a local repository to a remote repository
- Set the destination of a repo with `git remote`
- Send code to the remote repo with `git push`

If any of these seem less familiar than others, this is a good time to go back
to those lessons or resources and strengthen our understanding of them. We'll
need these basics as we move on to more Git.

## Preview Git Workflow

Git gives us a lot of special powers and over the next several lessons we'll explore some more of them. We'll learn one of the most useful Git features, branching. Specifically, we'll see how to:

- Create a branch
- Delete a branch
- Push a branch
- Pull a branch
- Discuss local and remote branches
- Merge a branch
- Practice merging branches
- Review a repositoryâ€™s history
- Review a Git commit's "diff"
- Unstage changes
- Revert changes

By the time we've worked through these lessons, you'll have a list of new Git
tools to use in your regular coding workflow.

## Conclusion

Building on the Git basics we've already acquired, we're now prepared to learn
more advanced Git actions like working with branches, examining Git history and
manipulating changes.
