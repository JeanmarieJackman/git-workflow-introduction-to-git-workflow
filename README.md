# Git Workflow

## Learning Goals

- Review Git basics
- Preview Git workflow

## Introduction

Developers use version control systems (VCS) to organize our code and the most
commonly used VCS is Git. Git provides a number of tools and techniques we can use
to improve our effectiveness as developers: creating backups, creating "save points"
where which we can "undo" to, sharing work between team-mates. Remember, Git, and
VCS in general, are all about giving us the ability to be unafraid to make changes.
By putting ***risk*** in check, we gain ***freedom***. That's a great place to be in
when we're writing code!

## Review Git Basics

At this point, there are several Git actions we should feel comfortable doing,
including:

- Identify how to initialize a Git repository with `git init`
- Check the status of a repository with `git status`
- Prepare file changes to be committed with `git add`
- Create a commit and apply a commit message with `git commit`
- Copy a repository to your local machine with `git clone`
- List remotes with `git remote`
- Duplicate other organizations' repositories into your own via GitHub with `git fork`
- Create a remote repository on GitHub
- Connect a local repository to a remote repository with `git remote`
- Send code to the remote repo with `git push`

If any of these seem less familiar than others, this is a good time to go back
to those lessons or resources and strengthen our understanding of them. We'll
need these basics as we move on to more Git.

## Preview Git Workflow

Git gives us a lot of special powers and over the next several lessons we'll
explore some more of them. We'll learn one of the most useful Git features,
***branching***. Specifically, we'll see how to:

- Create a branch
- Delete a branch
- Push a branch
- Pull a branch
- Discuss local and remote branches
- Merge a branch
- Practice merging branches

## Enrich Existing Git Skills

In addition, to accomplish the work we just described with branches, we'll sometimes
need Git to help us get more information or correct mistakes. 

- Review a repositoryâ€™s history ("Tell me the story of how this codebase changed since 4 days ago...")
- Review a Git commit's "diff" ("What changed in that commit?")
- Unstage changes ("Don't add _that_ to a commit!")
- Revert changes ("Undo that commit!")

By the time we've worked through these lessons, you'll have a list of new Git
tools to use in your regular coding workflow.

## Conclusion

Building on the Git basics we've already acquired, we're now prepared to learn
more advanced Git actions like working with branches, examining Git history and
manipulating changes.
